			<p><span class="first-three">Minnesota Youth Symphonies</span> is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing quality music education to students in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. There are four levels: Strings, Philharmonic, Repertory, and Symphony. Strings is an orchestra composed of only stringed instruments, but the other three are full orchestras, meaning they add wind instruments and percussion. </p>
