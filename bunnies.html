                        <p>In 4th grade, I invented Turnip, my (imaginary) bunny. In French class, I would call him 'Navet', because that is how you say 'turnip' in French. I also created my drawing. (If you want to see it,
 ask me personally, because whenever I upload a photo he looks messed up.) I really wish I had a bunny, but alas,
 my mom won't let me. My personal preference would be a mini-lop, in gray, then black, then spotted. I would be happy with any type, though.</p>
