			<p>UMTYMP stands for 'University of Minnesota Talented Youth Mathematics Program'. MathCep stands for 'School of Mathematics Center for Educational Programs'. It runs UMTYMP and other math programs. We have class once a week for two hours at the U of M, and have about 6-8 hours of homework per week. I know a lot of students who were forced to do UMTYMP, but I really wanted to do it, so my parents let me do it. It is a really great program because the curriculum goes in depth into each area of mathematics.</p>
