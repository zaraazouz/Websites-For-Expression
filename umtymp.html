			<h1>UMTYMP</h1>
			<p>UMTYMP stands for 'University of Minnesota Talented Youth Mathematics Program'. We have class once a week for two hours at the U of M, and have about 6-8 hours of homework per week. I know a lot of students who were forced to do UMTYMP, but I really wanted to do it, so my parents let me do it. It is a really great program because the curriculum goes in depth into each area of mathematics.</p>
