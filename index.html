			<h1 class="heading">All About Me - Zara Thomas</h1>
			<p>Hi! My name is Zara and I'm in 8th grade. I love math, music, coding, (other stuff), and most importantly STUART GIBBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
			
			<!--Math-->
			<h2 class="heading">Math</h2>
			<p>I love math! I do Khan Academy for fun. Math consumes my life. My favorite math course is probably Algebra I/Algebra II. Algebra II is my ultimate favorite, but I still love Algebra I.</p>

			<!--Music-->
			<h2 class="heading">Music</h2>
			<p>I have been playing the violin since I was 4 years old. At first, I hated practicing, but when I started MYS (explained later), I really enjoyed practicing and preforming. MYS stands for Minnesota Youth Symphonies. I am in the Repertory orchestra.</p>

			<!--Stuart Gibbs-->
 	     		<h2 class="heading">Stuart Gibbs</h2>
       			<p>Stuart Gibbs is by far my favorite author. His best series is the Spy School Series, but his other ones are the FunJungle Series, the MBA (Moon Base Alpha) Series, and the Last Musketeer Series. (I haven't read the Last Musketeer books, but I heard that they're good.)</p>
