			<p>I learned how to code on Khan Academy. I learned how to use JavaScript with the ProcessingJS library. In addition, I learned how to use HTML with JavaScript and jQuery, and also how to query with SQL. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/Beaniebopbunyip/projects">here</a> to view my programs on Khan Academy.
			<br>
			I then learned that Khan Academy wasn't always the best programming environment because it sometimes glitches, and won't allow external images. I then started coding on GitHub, which is a lot easier, and lets me do a lot more with my webpages. I recently participated in the Congressional App Challenge, where I had to design an app, and code a few pages. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://zaraazouz.github.io/App-Design/">here</a> to view my trial webpage.
