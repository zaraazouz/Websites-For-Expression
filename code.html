			<p><span class="first-three">I learned how</span> to code on Khan Academy. I learned how to use JavaScript with the ProcessingJS library. In addition, I learned how to use HTML with JavaScript and jQuery, and also how to query with SQL.

			I then learned that Khan Academy wasn't always the best programming environment because it sometimes glitches, and won't allow external images. I then started coding on GitHub, which is a lot easier, and lets me do a lot more with my webpages. I recently participated in the Congressional App Challenge, where I had to design an app, and code a few pages of it. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://zaraazouz.github.io/App-Design/">here</a> to view my trial webpage. (For the video explanation, click <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lEb5xx7J_MQ">here</a>.) I now have a TreeHouse account, which goes into more detail, and has many more programming languages. I am now learning Python!</p>
